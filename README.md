# Create choropleth Map

Bubbles can be rendered in different colors and sizes based on the data values of their assigned shape. You can add information to shapes such as population density, number of users, and more. You can enable bubbles using the MapShapeSource.bubbleSizeMapper. This property is used to specify the value based on which the bubble’s size has to be rendered. You can customize the bubble color based on the value returned from the MapShapeSource.bubbleColorValueMapper property. You can either return a value or a color from the bubbleColorValueMapper.
